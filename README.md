Welcome to the Pandas Challenge project! This project involves analyzing school and standardized test data using Pandas DataFrames within Jupyter Notebook. Below, you'll find details on the project, instructions for setup, and a brief overview of the tasks to be completed.

Background
- As the Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district, your role is pivotal in guiding strategic decisions regarding school budgets and priorities. The initial task is to analyze district-wide standardized test results, encompassing math and reading scores, alongside school-specific information.

Before You Begin
Repository Setup:
- Create a new repository named pandas-challenge.
- Clone this repository to your local computer.

Project Structure:
- Inside the cloned repository, create a folder named PyCitySchools.
- Your Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis will reside in this folder.

Dataset:
- Download the challenge files from Module 4 Challenge files to kickstart your analysis.

Version Control:
- Commit your Jupyter Notebook to the PyCitySchools folder.
- Push your changes to GitHub or GitLab.

Files
Ensure your project includes the following components:
- PyCitySchools folder: Contains your Jupyter Notebook (pandas_challenge.ipynb) for analysis.

Tasks Overview
- Your analysis will cover several key areas as outlined in the instructions:

District Summary
- Aggregate key metrics across the entire district.

School Summary
- Calculate metrics for each school, including types, budgets, and performance.

Top-Performing Schools
- Identify and display the top 5 schools based on overall passing rate.

Lowest-Performing Schools
- Identify and display the bottom 5 schools based on overall passing rate.

Math and Reading Scores by Grade
- Compute average scores for each grade level across all schools.

Scores by School Spending
- Analyze performance based on per-student spending ranges.

Scores by School Size
- Evaluate performance based on school size categories.

Scores by School Type
- Assess performance based on school type (charter vs district).

Deliverables
Your final Jupyter Notebook (pandas_challenge.ipynb) will include:
- Detailed code and Pandas operations used to generate each DataFrame.
- Written descriptions of at least two observable trends based on the data.

Additional Notes
- Ensure all calculations are performed accurately using appropriate Pandas methods.
- Use Markdown cells for clear explanations and interpretations of your findings.
- Organize your code logically and use comments to explain complex operations.

Conclusion

By completing this project, you will provide actionable insights into school performance metrics that will aid the school board and mayor in making informed decisions regarding budgets and educational strategies.
